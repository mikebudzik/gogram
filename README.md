# gogram
Project to learn golang - work on cryptograms

At this point, it includes a single statically defined cryptogram and counts/prints the occurrences of each letter. 
Not super useful, yet.

You can make your own cryptograms (up to 255 chars in length) at http://www.wordles.com/getmycrypto.aspx
